# iTMLE
This repository contains the reproducible code for the manuscript "Efficient Targeted Learning of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects for Multiple Subgroups in Observational Studies." 

* CV-iTMLE.R: cross-validated implementation of the iterative version of one-step TMLE (CV-iTMLE)
* DML.R: double machine learning (DML) method tailored to our parameter of interest
* iTMLE-DR-nonoverlap.R: comparison of the iterative version of one-step TMLE (iTMLE) with the double robust (DR) estimator under nonoverlapping subgroups
* iTMLE-DR-overlap.R: comparison of the iterative version of one-step TMLE (iTMLE) with the double robust (DR) estimator under overlapping subgroups

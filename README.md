# iTMLE
This repository contains the reproducible code for the manuscript "Efficient Targeted Learning of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects for Multiple Subgroups in Observational Studies." 

* CV-iTMLE-sim.R: cross-validated implementation of the iterative version of one-step TMLE
* DML-sim.R: double machine learning method tailored to our parameter of interest
* iTMLE-DR-nonoverlap.R: comparison of the iterative version of one-step TMLE with the double robust estimator under nonoverlapping subgroups
* iTMLE-DR-overlap.R: comparison of the iterative version of one-step TMLE with the double robust estimator under overlapping subgroups
